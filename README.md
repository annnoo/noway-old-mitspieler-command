# Noway4u Mitspieler Command (alte version)

Hello,

this is an old version of the ```!mitspieler``` command that we use in the chat of the german League of Legends Streamer [Noway4u](https://twitch.tv/noway4u_sir).


## Description

This service is just a simple HTTP API that gets called by nightbot and is written using the
[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework.

In general it does not more than querying the LoLPros Live Game API for Noway. 

As I said - I have no idea if this version still works. Currently we are using a slightly different version, but the code should guide you in the right direction ;)
If you want you can send me a DM on [Twitter] (https://twitter.com/annnoo96/).
